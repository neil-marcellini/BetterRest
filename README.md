# BetterRest
BetterRest uses machine learning to predict what time you should go to bed, based on when you want to wake up, how much sleep you want, and how much coffee you drink. I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAAdyg1dXQm4cde2-Gt_hdCHgq--7JmFD) from Hacking With Swift.

## What I learned
I learned how to use the CreateML app to train a machine learning model. The training data can be input as a csv file, and the model can be trained to predict a specified column. After making the model, it can be simply dragged into Xcode which will automatically generate a class for calling the model.
